## üìÑ Problem Statement

The competition challenged us to develop a machine learning solution that could personalize user profiles based on their online learning activities. We used data provided by the organizers to analyze various learning patterns and build a model to predict user profiles, ultimately aiming to enhance the learning experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - We handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling to ensure clean and standardized data.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed learning activity data to identify important patterns and relationships, using techniques like univariate and bivariate analysis, as well as correlation heatmaps.

### 3. **Modeling**
   - We evaluated three machine learning models:
     - **QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis)**: Performed the best due to its ability to handle class variance.
     - **XGBoost**: Handled large datasets efficiently but did not outperform QDA.
     - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Simpler but less effective in our case.
   - Cross-validation was applied to ensure robust model performance.

### 4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used to evaluate the models. QDA was the top performer with an accuracy of 97.72%.
